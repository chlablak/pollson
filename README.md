## Building

The sources scaffolding was done using the CLI tool for Angular2: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli

Follow theses steps (testing):
- install the CLI tool for Angular2, latest version (see the link above)
- (fork and) clone this repo on your computer (or download it)
- move to the project root directory, and run `npm install`
- run `npm start` and go at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

For others kind of building (production, githug-pages deployment, ...), take a look at the CLI's documentation (follow the link above).

## Documentation

To keep this README small, the documentation was moved in the `docs/` folder.
