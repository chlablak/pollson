**/pɔʊlzɒn/**

*Simple, interactive, fast polls managment.*

This repo contains the front-end web site for the pollson project.

You can find the online version here: https://chlablak.github.io/pollson/

The repo for the back-end can be found at https://github.com/chlablak/pollson-server.

### Preview

Here you can see the Angular2 components for manipuling questions. For a real-time preview, go on the online version (link above). Under the *Create* panel, we put these components for testing.

## Building

The sources scaffolding was done using the CLI tool for Angular2: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli

Follow theses steps (testing):
- install the CLI tool for Angular2, latest version (see the link above)
- (fork and) clone this repo on your computer (or download it)
- move to the project root directory, and run `npm install`
- run `npm start` and go at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

For others kind of building (production, githug-pages deployment, ...), take a look at the CLI's documentation (follow the link above).

For a fully functional local front-end, you have to [run the back-end](https://github.com/chlablak/pollson-server) first.

## Documentation

To keep this README small, the documentation was moved in the `docs/` folder.
